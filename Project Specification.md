## Project Overview
The **api-notification-service** is a microservice designed to manage and send notifications via SMS, Email, WhatsApp, and Slack. It is part of the MiroMotion project and aims to provide a reliable and scalable service for delivering messages and OTPs.

## Goals
- Develop a microservice for sending notifications through various channels.
- Implement template management using file-based storage.
- Ensure the service is secure and scalable.

## Requirements
### Functional Requirements
1. **Send Messages**: Ability to send messages through different channels.
2. **Message Status**: Capability to check the delivery status of messages.
3. **Template Management**: Manage message templates stored as files.
4. **Logging**: Maintain logs of sent messages and errors.

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**: The service must handle a high volume of messages efficiently.
2. **Scalability**: The service should scale horizontally to manage increases in load.
3. **Security**: Implement security measures to protect sensitive information.

## System Architecture
- Overview of the service architecture.
- Details of integration with other MiroMotion services.

## API Design
Detailed API endpoints as follows, providing comprehensive interface specifications for interaction with the service.

### Base URL
All API requests are made to the base URL:
```
https://api.miromotion.com/notification
```

### Send Message
- **Endpoint:** `/send`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Description:** Sends a message through the specified channel using a template.
- **Payload:**
  ```json
  {
    "channel": "email/sms/whatsapp/slack",
    "to": "recipient_address",
    "templateId": "template_identifier",
    "parameters": {
      // key-value pairs for template variables
    }
  }
  ```
- **Success Response:** `200 OK` with message ID and status.
- **Error Response:** Appropriate status code with error details.

### Check Message Status
- **Endpoint:** `/status/{messageId}`
- **Method:** `GET`
- **Description:** Retrieves the status of a previously sent message.
- **Parameters:**
    - `messageId`: The ID of the message to check.
- **Success Response:** `200 OK` with message status and details.
- **Error Response:** Appropriate status code with error details.

### Manage Templates
- **Endpoint:** `/templates`
- **Method:** `POST` for creating, `PUT` for updating, `GET` for listing, `DELETE` for deleting.
- **Description:** Manages templates for messages.
- **Payload for POST/PUT:**
  ```json
  {
    "templateId": "optional_for_POST",
    "channel": "email/sms/whatsapp/slack",
    "content": "template_content_with_placeholders"
  }
  ```
- **Success Response:** `200 OK` with template details.
- **Error Response:** Appropriate status code with error details.

### Security
- **Authentication:** All API requests require an API key sent as a header.
  ```plaintext
  X-API-Key: {your_api_key_here}
  ```

## Template Management
